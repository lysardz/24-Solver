# 24-Solver

This was a 24 solver I created during my internship in 2024. 
At the time, I used a tree-based structure to represent mathematical expressions, where each node stores an operation or a number. The tree is evaluated recursively to calculate results, allowing me to get all possible combinations of numbers and operators.
While I stayed away from looking up the answer online and approached the problem with the knowledge I had, I also received guidance on tree structures and expression evaluation, which helped me implement a cleaner final solution.
